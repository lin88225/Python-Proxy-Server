1. High-Level Protocol Design
The Web Proxy Server is designed as a multi-threaded intermediary that facilitates both HTTP and HTTPS communication.

Request Interception: The proxy listens on Port 4000. It parses the initial request line to determine the destination host and the method (GET, CONNECT, etc.).

Multi-threading: To prevent background system processes (like iCloud or Google Sync) from blocking user requests, each connection is assigned a unique threading.Thread.

HTTPS Tunneling: For CONNECT requests, the proxy establishes a bi-directional TCP tunnel. It relays raw bytes between the client and the server without decrypting the payload, ensuring end-to-end security.

Dynamic Blocking: Before relaying, the host is checked against a thread-safe blocked_urls set. If matched, a 403 Forbidden response is returned.

2. Efficiency Analysis & Timing Data
To satisfy the requirement of proving efficiency, the proxy implements a local caching mechanism using MD5 hashes of URLs. The following data was gathered during testing:

Conclusion: Serving from the local cache resulted in an efficiency gain of over 99.9%, significantly reducing bandwidth usage and latency.
